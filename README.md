# AmiraEncoder

Rotary encoder library with acceleration support.<br>
AmiraEncoder allows developers to use the rotary encoder with acceleration support to speed up the increment of the variable.<br>

---

## ✨ Features

- ✔️ Reliable direction detection (CW / CCW) 
- ✔️ Automatic acceleration based on rotation speed 
- ✔️ Configurable normal step and accelerated step
- ✔️ Bounce-resistant thanks to state-table logic (developed by Brian Low)
- ✔️ Supports internal or external pull-up resistors
- ✔️ Clean and beginner-friendly API
- ✔️ Pure full-step decoding (no half-step noise)
